# Sound
As stated in the CX16 documentation, it has three sound generators
- Yamaha YM2151: 8 channels, FM synthesis
- VERA PSG: 16 channels, 4 waveforms
- VERA PCM: 48 kHz, 16 bit, stereo

We may add a real chapter on sound in the future, but for now I recommend using the "ZSound" library from ZeroByteOrg:
