# CX16 Documentation
There is great documentation for the CX16 and we will reference it often in these tutorials. This section will serve as a catch-all for important links so you can easily reference them later.

## The VERA Programmer's Reference
Believe it or not, just about everything you need to know about graphics programming on the CX16 is contained in one document. Bookmark this, always have it open in a browser tab, print it, and wallpaper your room with it. You will refer to this document A LOT and learn to love it!

## Emulator, CX16, and VERA Docs
